**SWTech (South Western WA Technology Services)** was founded to bring world-class technical expertise to the South West region. We are a team of technology experts with over 20 years of experience in the industry.

### Our Story
Founded by **John Citizen**, an experienced technology engineer who has worked within some of the largest companies globally across **Australia, London, and Canada**, SWTech is built on a foundation of international, enterprise-grade experience. 

After decades of managing complex systems in major global hubs, John now calls the South West home. He established SWTech to leverage his extensive experience across a variety of technology ecosystems to help local organizations, businesses, and homeowners in the South West navigate their own technology challenges.
